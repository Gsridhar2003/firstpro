   <p>Late at night, four friends sat together in a vehicle, their faces glowing under the dim light. They weren’t out for fun, but on a mission to help. A neighbor’s child had fallen sick, and with no transport available, they decided to take the risk and drive through the dark roads to the nearest hospital.

    Though tired and uncertain, their unity gave them strength. One encouraged, another guided, while the rest stayed alert. Their courage paid off—the child was saved.
    
    The night taught them a lesson: true friendship is not in laughter alone, but in standing together when it matters most.
